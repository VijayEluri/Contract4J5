How to run "findbugs" on Contract4J5.


1) Install findbugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net).
2) Run the "findbugs" command, which invokes its own GUI.
3) Edit the paths in the findbugs project file "contract4j5.fb" to match your environment.
4) Using the File menu, open the project file "contract4j5.fb".
5) Click the "find bugs" button to generate a report.

Note that there is a few message about an unused field in an aspect. This 
appears to be an internally generated field. Also, we ignore a few other
warnings about exposing the internals of a class when a reference to an
array field is accessed through a getter and setter. Finally, findbugs warns
about "Reporter" objects not being initialized. This is actually handled
through an aspect that initializes the value "on demand".

Findbugs is quite useful. For example, it found a few cases where we had

if (string == null && string.length() == 0)...

when it should have been

if (string == null || string.length() == 0)...
