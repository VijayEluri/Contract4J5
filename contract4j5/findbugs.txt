How to run "findbugs" on Contract4J5.


1) Install findbugs (http://findbugs.sourceforge.net).
2) Run the "findbugs" command, which invokes its own GUI.
3) Using the File menu, open the project file "contract4j5.fb".
4) Click the "find bugs" button to generate a report.

Note that there is a few message about an unused field in an aspect. This 
appears to be an internally generated field. Also, we ignore a few other
warnings about exposing the internals of a class when a reference to an
array field is accessed through a getter and setter.

Findbugs is quite useful. For example, it found a few cases where we had

if (string == null && string.length() == 0)...

when it should have been

if (string == null || string.length() == 0)...
